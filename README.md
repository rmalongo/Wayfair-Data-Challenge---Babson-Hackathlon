# Problem Statment
*Our customers use visual media to inform, educate, and inspire purchasing decisions. You recently
launched an A/B test that showed when Rich Media (i.e. video, 3D imagery, and interactive content) is
present on our Product Details Page (PDP), we see upwards of 7% conversion rate lift depending on the
Product Class and content type (see Exhibit A & B for details). The Wayfair Merchandising team is
looking to capitalize on this opportunity by increasing Rich Media content across the catalog. Not every
product has this content as we rely on Suppliers to use our proprietary visual merchandising platform,
called WayMore, to design a PDP layout that differentiates their products (see exhibit C below for an
example*. 

# Scope:
Wayfair provided multiple datasets at the product class, Supplier, and SKU level that will help
inform what Rich Media gaps exist. These dataset are content recommendation, Supplier, and modulecount data
The Merchandising Analytics team (you) has been tasked with building a recommendation on one or
more of the following topics:
* Supplier outreach strategy -- including Suppliers to target, prioritized SKU lists, etc.
* Opportunity size for filling Rich Media gaps
* Improve the customer experience through product content optimization
* Any other recommendations for Merchandising Leadership
Merchandising Leadership is looking to you to create a 5-7 minute executive level presentation that
outlines your findings and recommendations
# Vision:
Design a predictive model:
y: whether to adopt rich advertisement
x:  the characteristics of a supplier
Compute Opportunity size
Projected conversion rate / revenue
Content optimization: best combination of product class + content type + modules amount
